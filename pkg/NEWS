Changes in Version 0.3

    o Added support for scoring forecasts with greater than 2
      alternatives.

    o Added data WeatherProbs, which contains three-category weather
      forecasts concerning temperature and precipitation.

    o Argument 'scaling' in calcscore() and plotscore() replaced with
      'bounds', so the user can supply desired lower and upper bounds
      of the scores.

    o Added a 'reverse' argument that, if TRUE, assigns larger 
      scores to good forecasters (as opposed to smaller scores).

Changes in Version 0.2

    o Fixed a bug associated with the beta family, where scaling=TRUE 
      sometimes still resulted in scores > 1.

    o Updated Merkle & Steyvers reference to reflect its acceptance.
